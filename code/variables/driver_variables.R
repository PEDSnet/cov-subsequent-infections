### File for constructing code to generate variables given a cohort
## Includes generation of intermediate tables but not functions for permanent output, which should be computed separately.


## Variable functions that need to be made:
variables <- c("rsv_diagnosis", "rsv_lab_positive", 
               "respiratory_lab_positive", "respiratory_infection_diagnosis",
               "any_infection_lab_positive", "any_infection_diagnosis",
               "covid_diagnosis", "covid_lab_positive",
               "influenza_diagnosis", "influenza_lab_positive",
               "age", "sex", "race_ethnicity", "medical_complexity", 
               "severity", "insurance", "insurance_carrier",
               "utilization", "vaccination")
